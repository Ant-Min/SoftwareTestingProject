# SoftwareTestingProject
For my "Software Testing and Automation" class

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
I ensure my code is functional and secure through both manual review and a testing method where I do a test run of the code and test specfic blocks of it. I am new to using Junit but I hope to incorporate it more into future software testing methods.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
I like to put myself in the position of the user and gauge the experience of the program through that perspective. Overall it helps to develop for user needs when I have a criteria of what the program should do and how it should perform so I can create a good program as quickly as possible. 

**How do I approach designing software?**
I try my best to separate my code so as to not have one huge program within the main method and I try to reuse variables when I can so there is less repetitive informaiton in my program. I'll use different classes when applicable or methods within the main class but not in the main method. I tend to use a lot of if-else statements when I code, but I will also use switch statements or try-catch for the faster processing. I haven't used data structures too much but I hope to incorporate that more in the future.
